    <h1>Shadow & Light</h1>
    <p>
      Shadow is a dark version of us. "A Second US". No?<br><br>
      NO, Shadow.<br><br>
      Shadow is a strong part of us, a part who will be every time with us.<br>
      He will lead us the way. The way to be safe.<br>
      But Shadow cannot follow you without the "Light".<br><br>
      So, when you have found your light — never let the light go out.<br>
      Treat the light like it’s the only way you can survive.<br><br>
      The body is only a "physical form" of oneself.<br>
      The shadow is the true self.<br><br>
      The shadow grows stronger with every ray of light.<br>
      And when the shadow is most visible,<br>
      then you have found your light, your hope, your path,<br>
      your other half — without whom it would not work.
